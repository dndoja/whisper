# Whisper

## Pitch

Whisper is a psychological turn based puzzle game focused on emotional manipulation and trickery. You play as a celestial being trying to prevent the mortal races from discovering the secret of immortality.

## Inspiration

The main inspirations for Whisper are Darkest Dungeon, for itâ€™s psychological aspect and the concept of Old Gods from World of Warcraft.

## Lore

A game in which you play as the Shadow of an Eldritch God, charged with keeping all mortal races... mortal. In this universe, Gods are not omnipresent nor are they omnipotent. They belong to a Pantheon and each of them has their own abilities suited to their duty. Naught, the God of death, ironically, cannot deliver Death by his own hand. As Death is a higher power, even to Gods. Instead, he is responsible for sabotaging all attempts that mortals make at achieving immortality.

Trying to maintain Death across an entire universe without omnipresence would be an impossible task, even for a God. To fulfill his duties as the God of Death, Naught used his power to create an army of shadows, each of them carrying his will. Each Divine Shadow was assigned to a planet inhabited by mortal races, where they stood ever vigilant to thwart the mortals' puny attempts at immortality. Entire kingdoms fell to their plots and they brought ruin to many civilizations which got close to uncovering the truth. Sharing their creator's inability to deliver Death, they had to be creative, whispering to and manipulating mortals to bring doom upon themselves.

This is where you come in, a Divine Shadow assigned to watch over humans, a very annoying mortal race which has had many attempts at immortality, all of them thwarted.

It is the Age of the Leonian Empire, one of the most powerful civilizations to ever grace the land of the humans. Through overwhelming strength and the destructive power of their alchemists they managed to conquer the entire continent and now, The Grand Emperor, Leonhardt, rules over it with might. Leonhardt's rule is regarded by many as Humanity's Golden Age, even the people who have had their families slaughtered during the wars with his army look at him as a grand benefactor.

There is but one major problem... The Emperor has no heir. His wife died in childbirth and the only son they had died in mysterious circumstances a few years ago. The Emperor is getting old and now fears about the future of his people when he's gone. There is no one suitable to take the throne. This is where his hubris took over. The Emperor ordered all of the alchemists in his empire to abandon everything and focus all of their work into finding a way to recreate the legendary Dagger of Undeath, a legendary artifact which is said to bring eternal life to the one stabbed by it. This would seem like a classic tale of a Mad King, but in this case, the Dagger of Undeath was real, it was one of the artifacts which belonged to a time before Death. These artifacts pose great danger to the very fabric of the universe and you, as a Divine Shadow, must stop them, or else...

## Mechanics

As a Shadow, you cannot interact with the physical world, you need to reach your goal using soul manipulation and trickery:

- **Shadowstep**: Instantly teleport to a Mortal who is vulnerable to manipulation. If `Shadowy Tendrils` are active, they will also move to the new target.  
- **Shadowy Tendrils**: Extend a pair of Shadowy Tendrils and invade the targeted Mortal's soul. Invading a Mortal's soul gives you access to their thoughts and enables you to use `Dark Whispers` and `Visions of Madness` on them. Only usable on Mortals with a `Wounded` soul.  
- **Dark Whispers**: Impersonate the Mortal's subconsciousness and plant a thought in their head, affecting their emotional state and pushing them one step further to the Brink of Madness.  
- **Visions of Madness**: Plant a powerful vision to a Mortal that is in the `Brink of Madness`, pushing them over the edge and greatly altering their behavior. Depending on their emotional state and type of vision chosen, it can bring greatly beneficial or catastrophic results.
