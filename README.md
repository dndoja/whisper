# Whisper

## Pitch 

Whisper is a top down turn based game. You play as the Divine Shadow and the goal is to stop The Emperor from reaching immortality.

## Lore

A game in which you play as a the shadow of an Eldrich God, charged with keeping all mortal races... mortal.
In this universe, Gods are not omnipresent nor are they omnipotent. 
They belong to a Pantheon and each of them has their own abilities suited to their duty. 
Naught, the God of death, ironically, cannot deliver Death by his own hand. 
As Death is a higher power, even to Gods. Instead, he is responsible for sabotaging
all attempts that mortals make at achieving immortality. 

Trying to maintain Death accross an entire universe without omnipresence would be an impossible task, even for a God.
To fulfill his duties as the God of Death, Naught used his power to create an army of shadows, each of them carrying his will.
Each Divine Shadow was assigned to a planet inhabited by mortal races, there they stood ever vigilant to thwart the mortals' puny attempts at immortalities. 
Entire kingdoms fell to their plots and they brought ruin to many civilizations which got close to uncovering the truth. 
Sharing their creator's inability to deliver Death, they had to be creative, whispering to and manipulating mortals to bring doom upon themselves.

This is where you come in, a Divine Shadow assigned to watch over humans, a very annoying mortal race which has had many attempts at immortality, all of them thwarted.

It is the Age of the Leonian Empire, one of the most powerful civilizations to ever grace the land of the humans. Through overwhelming strength and the destructive 
power of their alchemists they managed to conquer the entire continent and now, The Grand Emperor, Leonhardt, rules over it with might. Leonhardt's rule is regarded
by many as Humanity's Golden Age, even the people who have had their families slaughtered during the wars with his army look at him as a grand benefactor. 

There is but one major problem... The Emperor has no heir. His wife died in childbirth and the only son they had died in mysterious circumstances a few years ago.
The Emperor is getting old and now fears about the future of his people when he's gone. 
There is no one suitable to take the throne. This is where his hubris took over. 
The Emperor ordered all of the alchemists in his empire to abandon everything and focus all of their work into finding a way to recreate the legendary Dagger of Undeath, a legendary 
artifact which is said to bring eternal life to the one stabbed by it. This would seem like a classic tale of a Mad King, but in this case, the Dagger of Undeath was real,
it was one of the artifacts which belonged to from a time before Death. These artifacts pose great danger to the very fabric of the universe and you, as a Divine Shadow, 
must stop them, or else...

## Mechanics

As a Shadow, you cannot interact with the physical world, you need to reach your goal using soul manipulation and trickery:
- **Shadowstep**: You can move to any location in the map inside a single turn, ignoring terrain, closed doors and any other obstacle.
- **Observer Shade**: These are Shades you can place in locations and they will give you vision inside even if you are not currently located there.  
You get a limited amount of these but you can despawn them at will to regain stacks and place them somewhere else. These will log useful information in your Shadowy Tome.
- **Soul Mirror**: You can use this on Mortals to gain insights of their souls, their past, their ambitions and their biggest secrets. The amount of information you get is dependent on the Mortal's `Resolve`.
- **Soul Whisper**: This is your main tool of manipulation, you can whisper into Mortal's souls to plant thoughts in their head and have them do your bidding. The effectivity of this tool is dependend on the Mortal's `Resolve`. You get a limited amount of whispers each turn.
